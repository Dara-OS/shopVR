# Project Description

Design a store that provides people with a digital shopping experience in VR. The store can
be about anything you choose; however, it should have a topical narrative and it must not
closely relate to previous lab material.

Each project should contain some models (assets) that you created specifically for this
project. Self-created models can be part of what the shop sells, or form a side story (e.g.,
props, or decoration). You may not re-use the same objects that you have submitted earlier
in any of the lab work. You may use models from 3rd-party websites (e.g., Blend Swap),
however, the scene may not be a single 3rd-party model.

The project should provide basic locomotion that allow people traverse and explore the
scene (e.g., by gaze-based moving, and/or teleportation or other forms of moving around).
These locomotion method(s) should work with a mobile VR headset with an average
smartphone. Feel free to explore new forms of travel within the scene.

The project should also provide user interface elements that allow people to interact with
the shop and/or its products. The idea here is that the person engaging with the VR
environment should be able to perform some activities that support the process of shopping
in the virtual environment (e.g. by allowing them to inspect products, change the
environment, inquiring about products, selecting a product for purchase, etc.).

Each project should offer one additional interesting/cool/creative feature. Overall, the
project will reward creativity in all aspects!
